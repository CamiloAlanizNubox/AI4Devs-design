ChatGPT: Product Requirements Document (PRD) Writer

Thank you for the detailed description of the LTI software's Applicant Tracking System (ATS). Before we proceed to create User Stories, a Product Backlog, and Boards for Trello, I have a few more questions to ensure the documentation aligns with your project goals and the data you have: 
1. **User Personas:**  Who are the primary users of the ATS? Understanding the types of users (e.g., HR managers, recruiters, startup owners) will help in crafting user stories that are directly relevant to their needs. 
2. **Technical Specifications:**  Are there any specific technical constraints or requirements (like integration with existing systems, use of certain technologies or platforms) that we need to consider when designing the ATS? 
3. **Prioritization Criteria:**  What are the key features or functions that you consider most critical to implement first? This will help in prioritizing the product backlog effectively. 
4. **Lean Canvas:**  The Lean Canvas could be quite useful. Could you share it? It will help in understanding the business model, key metrics, and unique value proposition more clearly, which are crucial for aligning the product features with business goals. 
5. **C4 Data:**  What specific data or insights do you have from a C4 standpoint? This information could be essential for understanding the system architecture or any compliance-related aspects that need to be addressed.

Once I have this information, I can begin drafting the User Stories, setting up the Product Backlog, and planning the Trello boards accordingly.

<ANSWER TO SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS>
Description of the Three Main Use Cases for LTI's ATS
We'll now outline three primary use cases that illustrate how users interact with LTI's Applicant Tracking System. Each use case will include a diagram to visually represent the interactions.

Use Case 1: Job Posting Management
Description : The hiring manager needs to create and publish a job posting to multiple platforms directly from the ATS interface. The system allows the user to enter job details, set requirements, and choose publication channels. Once published, the ATS tracks the number of applications and provides analytics on the reach and effectiveness of the job posting.

Actors : Hiring managers, HR team members.

Main Steps :

Log into the ATS.
Select the option to create a new job posting.
Enter job details (title, description, requirements).
Choose where to publish the job (e.g., company career page, LinkedIn, job boards).
Publish the job posting.
View analytics on job posting effectiveness.
Diagram :
This would be a flowchart diagram showing the steps from creating a job posting to publishing and tracking its performance.

Use Case 2: Candidate Screening and Ranking
Description : Once candidates apply, the ATS automatically screens resumes based on predefined criteria such as skills, experience, and education. The system ranks candidates, making it easier for the hiring team to identify top candidates and move them to the interview stage.

Actors : HR team members, hiring managers.

Main Steps :

Receive applications submitted through various channels.
Automatically screen applications based on predefined criteria.
Rank candidates based on their match to the job requirements.
Notify HR team members of the top candidates.
Move top candidates to the interview stage.
Diagram :
A process diagram illustrating the screening and ranking workflow from application receipt to candidate shortlisting.

Use Case 3: Interview Scheduling
Description : The ATS integrates with calendar software to facilitate the scheduling of interviews. It automatically identifies available times for both interviewers and candidates and helps schedule interviews without the need for manual coordination.

Actors : Candidates, HR team members, interviewers.
